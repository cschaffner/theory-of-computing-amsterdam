I am an assistant professor in computer science with a background in physics and mathematics.
I am interested in understanding and exploiting mathematical structures from problems in computer science, particularly in compilers and programming languages.
My experience is mostly with concurrency in systems and semantics.
I have worked with Models of Computation, and their compilation to Cyber-Physical Systems, theorem proving software, computer architecture, semantics of programming languages and machine learning for compilers.

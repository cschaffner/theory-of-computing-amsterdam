I am an associate professor at the University of Amsterdam and a researcher at QuSoft. I'm interested in quantum algorithms and quantum information theory. Before coming to Amsterdam I was a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Cambridge and a post-doctoral researcher at IBM. I have a PhD from the University of Waterloo.
